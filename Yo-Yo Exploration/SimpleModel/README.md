# Simple Model (SM)
## SM Definitions
- $r_1$ is the radius of the cylinder used to represent the "finger" around which the top loop of the yo-yo string is wrapped
- $r_2$ is the radius of the central shaft of the yo-yo around which the bottom loop of the yo-yo string is wrapped
- $r_3$ is the total radius of the yo-yo, from the center of the central axis, to the outer edge of the yo-yo
- $y=0$ is the bottom of the cylinder ("finger")
- $y_{max}$ is the position of the center of the yo-yo at the top of its path. This is where the yo-yo starts at $t=0$
- $y_{min}$ is the position of the center of the yo-yo at the bottom of its path. This is where the yo-yo sits as it "sleeps"
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity
- $l$ is the total length of the yo-yo string, including the wraps around the "finger" and the central axis of the yo-yo. That is, $l=(2 \pi r_{1})+\frac{1}{2}(2 \pi r_{1})+(2 \pi r_{2})+d$
  - $(2 \pi r_{1})$ is the circumference of the "finger" cylinder
  - $frac{1}{2}(2 \pi r_{1})$ is used to account for the half wrap around the finger that arises from the slip knot style of the top of the yo-yo string
  - $(2 \pi r_{2})$ is the circumference of the central shaft of the yo-yo
  - $d$ is the length of yo-yo string between $y=0$ and the top of the central shaft of the yo-yo
- The direction of rotation for the yo-yo is *clockwise*
- The yo-yo string is initially tangent to the left side of the central shaft of the yo-yo
- After the yo-yo begins to climb up, the yo-yo string is tangent to the right side of the central shaft of the yo-yo

## Objectives
- Describe the linear motion of the yo-yo system by building the linear kinematic equations
- Describe the angular motion of the yo-yo system by building the angular kinematic equations

## Step Overview
During the motion of the yo-yo, four moments in time, or steps, have been identified.

### Step One
This is the moment in time right before the yo-yo begins to drop. For now, there is no force holding it up at ${y_{max}}$ but setting ${t=0}$ restricts movement. 

### Step Two
This is a moment in time when the yo-yo is traveling down, away from the cylinder.

### Step Three
This is the moment in time when the yo-yo is said to be "sleeping" at the bottom of the string.

## Step Four
This is a moment in time when the yo-yo is traveling up, toward the cylinder and against gravity.
