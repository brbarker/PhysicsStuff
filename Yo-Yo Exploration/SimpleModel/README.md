# Step Overview
During the motion of the yo-yo, four moments in time, or steps, have been identified. The first is the moment before releasing the yo-yo, while it is stationary at the top. The second is a moment in time that the yo-yo is traveling down, but before it reaches its lowest point. The third is the moment the yo-yo has reached its lowest point and is said to be "sleeping" momentarily. The fourth is a moment when the yo-yo is travelling back up towards the hand.
