This is the yo-yo system at $t=0$. The image on the *left* is a general diagram and the image on the *right* is a more mathematical approach to the system. This is where the first definitions are made to begin building the kinematic equations.

## Linear Kinematics
The yo-yo hasn't started to move yet, so we're free to say $$v(t)=0$$, $$a(t)=0$$
