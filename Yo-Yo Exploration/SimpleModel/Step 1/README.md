This is the yo-yo system at $t=0$. The image on the *left* is a general diagram and the image on the *right* is a more mathematical approach to the system. This is where the first definitions are made to begin building the kinematic equations.

## Linear Kinematics
The yo-yo hasn't started to move yet, so we're free to say

$$\begin{gather*}
v(t)=0 & (1) \\
a(t)=0 & (2) \\
y(t)=y_{max}=r_{3} & (3)
\end{gather*}$$

The length of the string ($d$) at this point is

$$\begin{gather*}
d=\sqrt{r_{2}^2+r_{3}^2} & (4)
\end{gather*}$$

where $d$ is the hypotenuse in a right triangle with short leg $r_{2}$ and long leg $r_{2}$.
